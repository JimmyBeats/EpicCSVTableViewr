# EpicCSVTableViewr

The best data table viewer this side of the Alamo. (Yes I mis-read the intructions initially and didn't realise it was
a SQL data file rather than a CSV until I'd already named the project and set it all up).

Have included a vagrant script which will set everything up, so just follow these steps:

* Checkout the code
* Run `vagrant up`
* Create a hosts entry: 192.168.33.20 ectv.local
* Once the vagrant machine is up, you can browse the solution at http://ectv.local

(If you really prefer me to upload this to EC2, happy to do so, just let me know)
